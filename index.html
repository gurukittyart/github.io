    <p> Krista seeks to satisfy the human need for story telling. Working in portraits; each subject is an outline of a persons life path. Krista’s forte is the eyes, the gateway to the soul. Traveling through time the perceiver melts into perceived. The technique of painting translucent layers of paint work in an altered state of mind to enhance the natural effect of undulating lines, vibrant colors, and facial patterning. She creates her portraits with a mixed media for the lucidity contrasted true to detailistic obsession. 

The artistic movement of psychedelic surrealism may be the final and greatest of 2D art. Limitless in its expression and boundlessly inter-dimensional; psychedelic surrealism is taking over the art  world by storm.

Krista’s has studied and been inspired by Alex Grey and Salvador Dali’s ability to  push the boundaries of what is socially acceptable for visual creation. First mimicking the logical drawings of DaVinci then painting to the lucidity of Van Gough or the chaos of Jackson Pollack. Her style has been coind by a Univeristy in Sarasota Flordia art professor as Revolutionary Metaphysicism; meaning that her work eclipses the traditional 

framework of modern art to revolutionize social and cultural ideas. Redefining ideas thorugh metaphysical properties. "Her works is revolutionary and metaphsycial  in nature, I've never seen anything like it."
